# Overview

## 🧩 Use Case Story: "PostPilot" — A Lightweight Blogging Dashboard

🎯 Objective
To build a simple yet functional blogging dashboard that allows users to view, manage, and simulate interactions with blog posts, comments, users, and albums using mock data from JSONPlaceholder.

## 👩‍💻 Target Users

- Frontend developers testing UI components
- Backend developers prototyping API calls
- QA engineers validating workflows
- Students learning RESTful API integration

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. User Profiles

- Fetch user data from /users
- Display name, email, address, and company info
- Simulate user login and profile editing

### 2. Blog Post Management

- Retrieve posts from /posts
- List posts with title and body preview
- View full post details with associated comments (/comments?postId=)
- Simulate creating, editing, and deleting posts (locally)

### 3. Comment Threads

- Display nested comment threads under each post
- Use /comments to fetch and filter by postId
- Allow users to "reply" (mocked locally)

### 4. Photo Albums

- Use /albums and /photos to display user albums
- Create a gallery view with thumbnails and titles
- Simulate uploading new photos (mocked)

### 5. Search & Filter

- Search posts by title or body
- Filter users by company or city
- Sort albums by number of photos

## 🔄 Data Flow Example

- User visits dashboard → App fetches /users and /posts
- User clicks on a post → App fetches /comments?postId=ID
- User views album → App fetches /albums?userId=ID → then /photos?albumId=ID

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React and Clean Architecture
- Backend: Node.js (optional, for proxying)
- API: JSONPlaceholder
- State Management: Redux
- Testing: Cypress or Jest

## 🚀 Benefits

- Rapid prototyping without backend setup
- Realistic data structure for UI testing
- Safe sandbox for learning RESTful APIs
- Easy integration with frontend frameworks
